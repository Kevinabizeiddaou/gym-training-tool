# AI Gym Trainer

An AI-powered gym trainer that monitors users' exercise form, counts repetitions, and provides real-time feedback to improve workout quality and safety.

## Features
- **Pose Detection and Analysis**: Tracks joint movements during exercises and identifies posture issues (e.g., knees misaligned during squats).
- **Repetition Counting**: Accurately counts exercise repetitions in real time.
- **Form Evaluation**: Scores each repetition based on posture correctness (scale: 0-1).
- **Workout Tracking**: Logs weights, tracks progress over time, and displays visual graphs of user improvements.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Alerts users about common mistakes in form (e.g., arching back during push-ups).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Pose Estimation**: Mediapipe
- **Machine Learning Models**: CNNs and RNNs for form evaluation and repetition counting
- **Data**: COCO, MPII, and custom exercise datasets
- **Frontend**: ReactJS (optional for UI development)
- **Backend**: Flask/Django for server-side processing

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Node.js (if working with ReactJS frontend)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-gym-trainer.git
   cd ai-gym-trainer
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. *(Optional)* Start the ReactJS frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Project Workflow
1. **Pose Detection**: Mediapipe extracts pose landmarks from webcam/video.
2. **Repetition Counting**: Detects complete exercise cycles.
3. **Form Evaluation**: Scores repetitions using a trained CNN model.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Provides real-time alerts for posture corrections.
